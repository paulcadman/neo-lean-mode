;;; Commentary:

;; Fetch the interactive goals at point over the Lean RPC session and show
;; them in the goal buffer.  `leanmacs-goal' opens the buffer on demand; while
;; it is visible it follows the cursor, refreshing after a short debounce
;; (like lean.nvim's `update_cooldown').
;;
;; Cursor-follow is gated on the goal buffer being visible -- so moving around
;; with the infoview closed costs nothing -- and each request carries a
;; monotonic id so a slow response cannot overwrite a newer one.
