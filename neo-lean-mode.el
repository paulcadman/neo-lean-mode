;;; Commentary:

;; A major mode for editing Lean 4 source.  This file defines `neo-lean-mode'
;; and configures Eglot to talk to the Lean language server (`lake serve').
;;
;; This milestone keeps the mode itself minimal -- just enough for Eglot
;; to attach.  Full font-lock, indentation and imenu come later.  The point
;; of the current milestone is the interactive RPC layer (see `neo-lean-rpc.el')
;; and the goal display (`neo-lean-goal').

;;;; Semantic-tokens refresh (LSP coloring)

;; Lean colors the buffer through Eglot's `eglot-semantic-tokens-mode', but it
;; elaborates a file incrementally and reports semantic tokens only for the part
;; it has processed so far.  Eglot fires a single `textDocument/semanticTokens/
;; full' request -- often while elaboration is still mid-flight -- caches that
;; partial answer, and never asks again: the document text does not change so its
;; cache stays "current", and Lean (unlike the LSP spec's intent) does not send
;; `workspace/semanticTokens/refresh' when more tokens become ready.  The result
;; is the "sometimes only half the file is highlighted" symptom -- whatever had
;; elaborated when that one request landed is all you ever get.
;;
;; Lean does, however, stream `$/lean/fileProgress' as elaboration advances, so
;; we use it as the "more tokens may be ready" signal: re-request tokens
;; (debounced) on progress, which also lands a final refresh once the file goes
;; quiet and the token set is complete.  The spec-correct
;; `workspace/semanticTokens/refresh' is handled too, as insurance for server
;; versions that do send it.

;; Eglot internal: the buffer-local semantic-token cache.  Declared so the
;; byte-compiler is happy on Eglot versions that predate it; we only touch it
;; when `eglot-semantic-tokens-mode' is actually on.
