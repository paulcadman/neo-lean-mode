;;; Commentary:

;; Pure rendering of Lean's interactive goal data structures to plain text.
;; These functions take the plists/vectors that Eglot's JSON parser produces
;; (objects -> keyword plists, arrays -> vectors) and have no side effects, so
;; they are unit-testable without a running server.
;;
;; The `tag' payloads of `TaggedText'/`CodeWithInfos' carry per-subexpression
;; info (an `InfoWithCtx' handle the server uses to answer questions about that
;; exact subterm, plus its `subexprPos').  We render the text leaves as before
;; but attach that info as text properties (`leanmacs-info' /
;; `leanmacs-subexpr-pos') on the spans they cover, which is what makes the goal
;; interactive: commands like go-to-definition read the info under point and
;; call the server.  Because `equal' ignores text properties on strings, the
;; plain-text rendering (and its tests) is unchanged.
